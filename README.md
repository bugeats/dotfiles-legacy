![Neovim Looking Pretty](http://i.imgur.com/HBaCTAu.png)

If you want to run Neovim and see pretty colors, you have two options:

- [iTerm 2 nightly build](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads/nightly/#/section/home).
- [Neovim.app](https://github.com/rogual/neovim-dot-app)

[Droid Sans Mono](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono) is the recommended typeface.
